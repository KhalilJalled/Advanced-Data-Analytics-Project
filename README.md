# Advanced-Data-Analytics-Project
The project is a credit card fraud detection system built using Random Forest Classifier. 
In addition, to handle the discrepencies between the number of fraudulous transactions and the valid transactions, we trained a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) model to generate more fraudulous 
transactions that are resemble the ones existing in tha dataset. 
Below is a link to a drive containing the full dataset in a csv format.
